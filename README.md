## Project Info

Based on design provided by [scrimba](https://www.figma.com/file/FqsxRUhAaXM4ezddQK0CdR/Tenzies?t=KM8via778tvLycUQ-0). Developed with React, Express, and Socket.io. Works well as a static single page website by locating client/build in server/public. Hosted by AWS EC2 instance (if they don't take it down because I don't pay). Managed using pm2.
